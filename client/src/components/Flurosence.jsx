                            <p className='text_justify'>An efficient way to save money while buying a diamond is to consider fluorescence. A faint
                                fluorescence is more than acceptable, while a medium fluorescence is still okay. Anything more
                                than this may result in a cloudy-looking diamond, especially concerning larger stones. </p>
